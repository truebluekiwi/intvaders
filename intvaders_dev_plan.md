# intvaders.com: Game Description & Objectives

## Game Overview

**intvaders.com** is an innovative educational arcade shooter that reimagines the classic Space Invaders experience through the lens of mathematical learning. Players take on the role of Earth's last defender, wielding an advanced mathematical combat system to repel waves of numerical alien invaders that threaten humanity.

## Core Gameplay Concept

### The Mathematical Battlefield
Instead of traditional aliens, players face off against **stylized numerical invaders** - each alien is represented by a number (0-9) with a hostile, retro-futuristic design. These mathematical enemies descend from space in classic Space Invaders formation, but their defeat requires more than simple reflexes - it demands mathematical precision and strategic thinking.

### Visual Aesthetic
- **Retro Pixel Art Style**: Classic 1980s arcade aesthetic with modern mathematical twists
- **Numerical Aliens**: Each number (0-9) is stylized as a menacing alien entity with glowing edges, antennae, and hostile expressions
- **Mathematical HUD**: Advanced heads-up display showing equation building, score tracking, and mathematical progress
- **Space Combat Environment**: Deep space backdrop with scrolling stars and ambient mathematical equations

## Dual Combat System

### 1. Standard Torpedo Mode (Traditional Combat)
- **Unlimited Ammunition**: Fire standard energy torpedoes at alien targets
- **Resource Management**: Each shot consumes Fire Power Points (FPP)
- **Brute Force Approach**: Higher-value aliens require multiple hits to destroy
 - Aliens 1-3: 1 hit to destroy
 - Aliens 4-6: 2 hits to destroy  
 - Aliens 7-9: 3 hits to destroy
- **Strategic Use**: Emergency option when mathematical solutions aren't immediately apparent

### 2. Calculating Attack Mode (Mathematical Combat)
- **Zero FPP Cost**: Successful mathematical equations consume no Fire Power Points
- **Multi-Shot Sequences**: Players must fire at aliens in specific mathematical order
- **Equation Building**: Create valid mathematical expressions using alien numbers
- **Bonus Rewards**: Successful calculations grant armor points equal to the equation result
- **Four Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (×), Division (÷)

## Mathematical Combat Examples

### Simple Addition Attack
1. Player selects Addition mode
2. Targets alien showing "3" (first operand)
3. Targets alien showing "5" (second operand)
4. Targets alien showing "8" (result)
5. Equation: 3 + 5 = 8 ✓
6. **Result**: All three aliens destroyed, +8 armor points gained, zero FPP consumed

### Complex Multi-Operation Chain
1. Available aliens: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 5, 17
2. Player executes: 2 × 3 = 6, then 6 + 12 - 1 = 17
3. **Result**: Six aliens destroyed in sequence, massive armor boost, zero FPP cost

### Strategic Pressure Scenario
- Aliens approaching critical distance
- Player must choose: Quick standard shots (costs FPP) or risk time for mathematical solution
- **Risk/Reward**: Mathematical solutions provide better rewards but require more time and precision

## Infinite Difficulty Progression

### Progressive Mathematical Complexity
- **Waves 1-10**: Single digits (1-9) - Basic arithmetic foundations
- **Waves 11-25**: Two digits (10-99) - Intermediate calculations
- **Waves 26-50**: Three digits (100-999) - Advanced mental math
- **Waves 51-100**: Decimals introduced (0.1, 1.5, 2.75) - Precision mathematics
- **Waves 101-200**: Negative numbers and fractions (1/2, -5, 3/4) - Complex operations
- **Waves 201+**: Irrational numbers (π, e), square roots, advanced mathematical concepts

### Adaptive Intelligence Scaling
The game continuously adapts to challenge even mathematical prodigies:
- **Early Waves**: 2 + 3 = 5
- **Intermediate Waves**: 12 × 7 - 23 + 6 = 67
- **Advanced Waves**: √144 × π + 15² - 87 = ?
