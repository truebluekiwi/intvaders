# MathVaders Development Plan

## Project Overview

**Game Title:** MathVaders  
**Genre:** Educational Arcade Shooter  
**Platform:** Web Browser (Desktop & Mobile)  
**Target Audience:** Students, educators, math enthusiasts, competitive gamers  
**Development Timeline:** 24 weeks (6 months)  
**Team Size:** 3-5 developers (1 Frontend Lead, 1 Backend Lead, 1 Game Developer, 1 DevOps, 1 UI/UX Designer)

## Game Concept Summary

MathVaders transforms the classic Space Invaders gameplay into an educational mathematical combat experience. Players defend Earth from numerical alien invaders using two attack modes:

1. **Standard Torpedo Mode**: Traditional shooting that consumes Fire Power Points (FPP)
2. **Calculating Attack Mode**: Mathematical equation-based attacks that reward correct calculations with bonus armor and zero FPP cost

The game features infinite difficulty scaling, strict PEMDAS compliance, competitive multiplayer modes, and adaptive educational features.

## Framework Choice Rationale
